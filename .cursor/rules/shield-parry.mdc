# Shield Parry Minigame

## Overview
The Shield Parry minigame is a browser-based game inspired by Doom: Dark Ages, focusing on the parrying mechanic. Players must parry incoming projectiles and defeat enemies using shield slams.

## Main Components

### Game Entry Point
The game is initialized in [shield-parry.md](mdc:shield-parry.md) which loads the main game script and sets up the canvas.

### Code Breakdown
- Core game logic: [assets/js/shield-parry.js](mdc:assets/js/shield-parry.js)
- Input handling: [assets/js/input-handler.js](mdc:assets/js/input-handler.js)
- Sound management: [assets/js/sound-manager.js](mdc:assets/js/sound-manager.js)
- Visual effects: [assets/js/visual-effects.js](mdc:assets/js/visual-effects.js)

## Game Controls
- WASD: Movement
- SPACE: Parry green projectiles
- LEFT SHIFT: Shield slam stunned (yellow) enemies
- M: Mute/Unmute sound

## Game Mechanics
1. Players must parry incoming green projectiles
2. Successful parries stun enemies (turning them yellow)
3. Stunned enemies can be destroyed with a shield slam
4. Health bar tracks player's remaining health

## Development Notes
- Adding more levels is as simple as adding to the levels array in the game constructor

## Future Enhancements
- Add more levels
- More variation in enemies and projectiles
- Use free assets for the sprites instead of drawn shapes
- Refactor levels to be external to the main game file
- Refactor enemies and projectiles to be external to the main game file
- Add a difficulty setting to the game that controls base projectile speed and base damage taken
