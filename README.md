A portfolio showcasing my technical skills, including backend development, frontend design, and automation using various technologies.

## What I learned:

- **Go language** for standing up an API endpoint and connecting to a PostgreSQL database.
- **PostgreSQL** for handling data storage.
- **Docker** for containerization and deployment.
- **Bootstrap** and **FontAwesome** for responsive and visually appealing design.

## What I enhanced:
- **JavaScript** for frontend interactivity and rendering of dynamic content.
- **C#** and **Selenium** for test automation.
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation and deployment.
