        The landscape of technical recruiting has been dramatically transformed by the rise of AI tools. What was once a straightforward process of reviewing resumes, conducting technical assessments, and interviewing candidates has become a complex game of separating genuine talent from AI-enhanced applications. As companies and candidates both leverage AI tools, we're witnessing the need for a fundamental rethinking of how technical talent is identified, assessed, and hired.

        The role of Quality Assurance has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past decade. Gone are the days when QA teams were isolated groups who tested code after development was "complete." Today's modern QA professionals are deeply integrated into the development process. This shift represents not just a change in tools, but a fundamental rethinking of how quality is built into software.

			AI tools have been improving at an incredible rate lately. ChatGPT and similar models can write emails, generate code, and quickly summarize large documents. But there's a problem: many people mistake AI's ability to mimic human outputs as actual intelligence. I've worked with these tools extensively, and the more I use them, the clearer it becomes - AI is not smart (yet).

            AI models are trained to maximize helpfulness, which often translates to agreeableness. This behavior stems from several factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) prioritizes helpful, harmless responses</li>
            <li>Models are penalized for appearing argumentative or contradicting users</li>
            <li>They lack the ability to truly evaluate the merit of ideas independently</li>
            <li>They have no intrinsic motivation to correct users unless specifically prompted to do so</li>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">

        AI will role-play whatever you tell it to. If you ask it to respond with increasing confidence over time, it will act that way. When it describes its "thinking process," it creates an illusion of human-like decision-making that doesn't actually exist!

        It's easy to fall into a trap of simply copy and pasting the solutions the AI provided, just like a developer previously may have copy and pasted a solution from StackOverflow.

    As software developers, we're witnessing a significant shift in how we work with the emergence of AI-powered development tools. Whether it's ChatGPT helping us debug code or GitHub Copilot suggesting implementations, AI has become another valuable tool in our development toolkit. However, like any tool, its effectiveness depends on how we use it.

    Just like how you might explain a problem differently to a junior developer versus a senior developer, the way you communicate with AI tools can significantly impact the quality of their responses. Let's explore some effective strategies:
</p>

<h3><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i> Provide Context Through Examples</h3>
<p>When asking AI to help with code, include examples of your existing implementation. This helps the AI understand your coding style and patterns, leading to more consistent and useful suggestions. For instance, when working on unit tests, share your existing test structure so the AI can follow the same patterns and conventions.</p>
