## Chess

Chess has become my latest obsession. It's easy to play and impossible to master. Just the way I like my games!

As a beginner to studying chess myself, I highly recommend the following:

<ul>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-pawn"></i> <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess.com Guides for "New to Chess" and "Beginner"</a></li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-knight"></i> <a href="https://www.chessable.com/chess-basics/course/27081/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chessable.com free courses like Chess Basics</a></li>
	<li><i class="fas fa-chess-bishop"></i> <a href="https://www.chessable.com/course/21302/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smity's Opening Fundamentals (the Intro and Section I are incredibly useful)</a></li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-rook"></i> DO learn about opening fundamentals. DO NOT spend time this early on with memorizing opening moves and variations.</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-queen"></i> Be patient! At the very least think if your move will give up a piece for free (blunder checks).</li>
	<li><i class="fas fa-chess-king"></i> Learn chess notation, notate your games, and review them against a chess engine afterwards. You'll find common areas where you are making mistakes and can focus on those spots more.</li>
</ul>

## Magic: The Gathering (MTG)
<p>I've played MTG since I was a kid. I stopped playing it during high school and college, and returned to it later as an adult.</p>

## Board Games
<p>Board games and tabletop games have come a long way since the old classic Monopoly, Clue, and Scrabble. Twice a month I host a game night with a small-knit group of local friends to play more games!</p>
