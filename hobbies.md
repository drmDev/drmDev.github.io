## Chess

Chess has become my latest obsession. It's simple to learn but impossible to master—exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy!

### Recommendations for Beginners:
<ul>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-pawn"></i> <a href="https://www.chess.com/lessons/guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chess.com Guides for "New to Chess" and "Beginner"</a></li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-knight"></i> <a href="https://www.chessable.com/chess-basics/course/27081/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chessable.com free courses like Chess Basics</a></li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-bishop"></i> <a href="https://www.chessable.com/course/21302/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smithy's Opening Fundamentals</a> (the Intro and Section I are incredibly useful)</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-rook"></i> Focus on understanding opening fundamentals instead of memorizing lines. Early on, your opponents won’t play the best moves, so adaptability matters more than rote memory.</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-queen"></i> Always perform "blunder checks" before making your move. Avoid giving away pieces for free! Start with longer time controls like 15/10 to give yourself time to think.</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-king"></i> Learn chess notation, record your games, and analyze them with an engine to identify common mistakes and improve over time.</li>
</ul>

## Magic: The Gathering (MTG)

I’ve been playing MTG since I was a kid. After taking a break in high school and college, I rediscovered the game as an adult, and it has become one of my favorite hobbies.

## Board Games

Board games and tabletop games have evolved far beyond the classics like Monopoly, Clue, and Scrabble. Twice a month, I host a game night with close friends to explore modern games that bring new strategies and experiences.

### Explore Board Games

## Speedrunning

<p>Speedrunning is one of my favorite ways to combine gaming with goal-setting and self-improvement. I focus mainly on retro classics from the NES and SNES era, as well as modern "retro-style" games like <em>Prison City</em> and <em>Iron Meat</em>.</p>

<p>What I love most about speedrunning is breaking the challenge into smaller goals—practicing individual sections until they feel smooth—before combining everything for a live run. It's a lot like a musician rehearsing parts of a song before performing the full piece. The thrill of finally nailing a full run is unmatched, and it’s a fun way to gamify games I already love playing.</p>

<p>Check out my runs on <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/users/nescapeplan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speedrun.com</a>.</p>
