<h2 id="chess">Chess</h2>

<p>Chess has become my latest obsession. It’s simple to learn but impossible to master—exactly the kind of challenge I enjoy!</p>

    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-rook"></i> Focus on understanding opening fundamentals instead of memorizing lines. Early on, your opponents won’t play the best moves, so adaptability matters more than rote memory.</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-queen"></i> Always perform "blunder checks" before making your move. Avoid giving away pieces for free! Start with longer time controls like 15/10 to give yourself time to think.</li>
    <li><i class="fas fa-chess-king"></i> Learn chess notation, record your games, and analyze them with an engine to identify common mistakes and improve over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="magic-the-gathering-mtg">Magic: The Gathering (MTG)</h2>

<p>I’ve been playing MTG since I was a kid. After taking a break in high school and college, I rediscovered the game as an adult, and it has become one of my favorite hobbies.</p>

<h2 id="board-games">Board Games</h2>

<p>Board games and tabletop games have evolved far beyond the classics like Monopoly, Clue, and Scrabble. Twice a month, I host a game night with close friends to explore modern games that bring new strategies and experiences.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cards Against Humanity</strong>: A guaranteed laugh-out-loud experience, but definitely one for adults only. Perfect for breaking the ice or spicing up game night with friends who enjoy edgy humor.</li>
  <li><strong>Dominion</strong>: The gold standard of deck-building games. I love how every game feels different thanks to the variety of card setups. Building a streamlined, efficient deck that executes the way you want is endlessly satisfying.</li>
  <li><strong>Lords of Waterdeep</strong>: My go-to game for worker placement and resource management. Set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe, it combines strategy and planning with a splash of intrigue. It’s a longer game but deeply rewarding for those who enjoy plotting several moves ahead.</li>
  <li><strong>Betrayal at House on the Hill</strong>: The ultimate game for Halloween or horror fans. The first half lets you cooperatively explore a haunted mansion, uncovering creepy surprises. Then the twist hits—one player becomes a traitor, and the game flips into a unique scenario. No two games are ever the same, which keeps it exciting and fresh.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, I’ll add a database to filter through my Board Game collection.</p>

<h2 id="speedrunning">Speedrunning</h2>

<p>Speedrunning is one of my favorite ways to combine gaming with goal-setting and self-improvement. I focus mainly on retro classics from the NES and SNES era, as well as modern "retro-style" games like <em>Prison City</em> and <em>Iron Meat</em>.</p>

<p>What I love most about speedrunning is breaking the challenge into smaller goals—practicing individual sections until they feel smooth—before combining everything for a live run. It's a lot like a musician rehearsing parts of a song before performing the full piece. The thrill of finally nailing a full run is unmatched, and it’s a fun way to gamify games I already love playing.</p>
